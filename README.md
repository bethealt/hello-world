# hello-world
Greetings!

It is my pleasure to share with you the narcissistic ravings of an armchair foodie confined to her apartment. I travel through the web, social media, and streaming video to develop my musings.

Please join me as I explore the full spectrum of snacks, street food, comfort food, and haute cuisine across nationalities and ethnicities.
